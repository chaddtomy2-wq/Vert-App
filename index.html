const ENTRIES = [
  { id: 1, title: "Train Your Mind Like Your Body", pillar: "Mental Discipline", content: "Placebo is considered one of the most impactful effects in pharmacology.\n\nIn other words, the human mind is powerful enough to change your biology.\n\nThe mind doesn't just interpret reality — it helps create it.\n\nTrain and hone your thoughts like you train your body." },
  { id: 2, title: "The Narrative Layer Creates Suffering", pillar: "Perception", content: "One of the most transformative perspective shifts is learning to distinguish between what happens to you and the story you tell yourself about what happens to you.\n\nMost suffering doesn't come from events themselves, but from the narrative layer we wrap around them — the assumptions about what it means, what it says about us, and what will happen next.\n\nYour first interpretation is often just your most practiced one, not your most accurate one.\n\nThere is a space between stimulus and response. That space is where freedom lives. Most people never notice it exists.\n\nWhen you catch yourself storytelling — \"I notice I'm telling myself this means X\" — you regain power over your emotional life. You stop being a passive recipient of reactions and become someone who chooses how to engage with difficulty." },
  { id: 3, title: "State → Story → Action → Life", pillar: "Perception", content: "The state you're in dictates the story you tell yourself.\n\nThe story you tell yourself dictates the action you take.\n\nThe actions you take dictate the life you live." },
  { id: 4, title: "The Subconscious Cannot Tell Pretend From Real", pillar: "Identity", content: "The subconscious mind cannot understand sarcasm or irony. It does not know the difference between an imagined event and a real memory.\n\nActors, fully aware they are performing, still fall victim to this effect.\n\nJames Gandolfini once said that playing Tony Soprano for years \"left seeds of Tony inside him.\"\n\nThe subconscious cannot tell when you are playing pretend.\n\nRepeatedly acting as something will slowly wire it into existence." },
  { id: 5, title: "Collapse the Gap Between Decision and Action", pillar: "Mental Discipline", content: "The distance between deciding and doing is one of the most reliable predictors of whether your life will be extraordinary or ordinary.\n\nNot talent. Not circumstances. Not even the quality of your decisions — but how quickly you collapse the space between intention and execution.\n\nWhen you move from \"I should do this\" to physically doing it within hours instead of weeks, you operate differently.\n\nSuccess isn't about outcomes — it's about iteration speed.\n\nThe faster your decisions meet reality, the faster you receive feedback. The brutal honesty of immediate feedback separates extraordinary results from extraordinary intentions." },
  { id: 6, title: "The Solomon Paradox — We Are Wiser For Others", pillar: "Cognitive Biases", content: "We often possess wisdom we cannot access when we need it most.\n\nWhen advising others, we see patterns clearly. We offer balanced, compassionate insight that acknowledges complexity without drowning in it.\n\nYet when facing our own decisions, we become immersed, reactive, and narrow in perspective.\n\nThe paradox is not that we lack wisdom — it's that we lack distance.\n\nPerspective, not intelligence, is often the difference between foolishness and insight." },
  { id: 7, title: "Meditation Resets Your Baseline", pillar: "Mindfulness", content: "Meditation is not a dramatic breakthrough. It is the gradual rewiring of your relationship with your own mind.\n\nMost people are swept away by an endless internal monologue. Meditation creates distance from thought.\n\nOver months and years, this changes your emotional baseline.\n\nInstead of being consumed by resistance and commentary, you learn to meet experience directly.\n\nWhat you resist persists. What you observe transforms." },
  { id: 8, title: "Stop Fighting Reality", pillar: "Mindfulness", content: "The exhausting war between what is and what you think should be is the fundamental human struggle.\n\nYou cannot work against reality because you are not separate from it.\n\nThe world includes your resistance. When you fight reality, reality wins.\n\nPower lies not in opposing what is happening, but in choosing how you meet it.\n\nWhat you resist persists. What you meet with awareness transforms." },
  { id: 9, title: "Identity Is Built Through Repetition", pillar: "Identity", content: "Identity is not what you believe about yourself — it is what your nervous system has learned through repetition.\n\nYou do not become disciplined by deciding to be disciplined. You become disciplined by behaving that way until the pattern becomes automatic.\n\nAround 50–70 days of consistent behavior begins to feel natural.\n\nThe basal ganglia absorbs repetition and turns conscious effort into automatic action.\n\nYou become the person you repeatedly act as." },
  { id: 10, title: "Never Let Illness Become Your Identity", pillar: "Identity", content: "Guard your mind viciously.\n\nIt is a catastrophic mistake to curse your own identity in any way.\n\nNever allow illness, struggle, or suffering to become who you are.\n\nEven in the face of difficulty, dignity remains.\n\nYou may experience symptoms. You may feel weakness.\n\nBut you are not the illness." },
  { id: 11, title: "Live One Day At A Time", pillar: "Resilience", content: "Anyone can carry their burden, however hard, until nightfall.\n\nAnyone can do their work, however hard, for one day.\n\nAnyone can live patiently and purely until the sun goes down.\n\nAnd this is all life really means." },
  { id: 12, title: "Success Is the Failures You Avoid", pillar: "Wealth & Power", content: "Success is largely the failures you avoid.\n\nHealth is the injuries you don't sustain.\nWealth is the purchases you don't make.\nHappiness is the objects you don't desire.\nPeace of mind is the arguments you don't engage.\n\nAvoid the bad to protect the good." },
  { id: 13, title: "Nearly Everything Takes Longer Than You Think", pillar: "Resilience", content: "Nearly everything worthwhile takes longer than you expect.\n\nStart anyway.\nStop obsessing over the clock." },
  { id: 14, title: "You Can Be Uncertain and Still Move Forward", pillar: "Mental Discipline", content: "You are allowed to be uncertain and still move forward." },
  { id: 15, title: "Use What Is Instead of Complaining About What Should Be", pillar: "Leadership", content: "Some people see what should be and complain when they don't get their due.\n\nOthers see what is — and figure out how to use it to their advantage." },
  { id: 16, title: "You Don't Have to Drink the Rain", pillar: "Mindfulness", content: "When water falls on you like rain, it evaporates.\n\nThoughts are the same.\n\nYou may feel fear, anger, sadness — but you don't have to absorb them.\n\nLet the thought pass the way rain dries in the sun.\n\nYou can experience a feeling without claiming it as identity." },
  { id: 17, title: "The Mind Makes Heaven or Hell", pillar: "Perception", content: "The mind itself is a place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, or a hell of heaven." },

  { id: 19, title: "Attention Shapes Reality", pillar: "Perception", content: "Perception, attention, and reality are three sides of the same crucible.\n\nChange one and you change the others.\n\nYour reality is shaped by what you attend to." },
  { id: 20, title: "Unhappiness Comes From Wanting What You Don't Have", pillar: "Mindfulness", content: "If you are unhappy, think about what you desire that you don't have." },
  { id: 21, title: "Achievements Do Not Create Happiness", pillar: "Perception", content: "If past achievements didn't make you meaningfully happier, future achievements won't either.\n\nYou are roughly as happy as you decide to be today.\n\nLong-term happiness doesn't arrive when you achieve something.\n\nIt arrives when you decide to be happy — even after you achieve it." },
  { id: 22, title: "Laziness Is Focusing on Effort Instead of Outcome", pillar: "Mental Discipline", content: "Laziness is the habit of thinking about the effort rather than the outcome." },
  { id: 23, title: "Discipline Makes Today Harder and Tomorrow Easier", pillar: "Mental Discipline", content: "Excuses make today easier and tomorrow harder.\n\nDiscipline makes today harder and tomorrow easier." },

  { id: 25, title: "Anxiety Is Overthinking and Underreacting", pillar: "Cognitive Biases", content: "Anxiety is overthinking and underreacting.\n\nStress often comes from not taking action toward something you have control over." },
